# Attendence Token
## The Idea

When people run meetups, tutorials or workshops, they might want a way to show who pitched up. Attendees which claim attendence on their CVs or LinkedIns can then also be checked by checking for these attendence tokens which are unique to each workshop and can only be minted and distributed by the person or organsition in charge of the workshop.

## Goals
* Build a smart contract to impelement the token functionality.

* Build a front end:
    * where the organiser can generate new tokens
    * where account's tokens can be viewed and requested
